# Signal iOS App: Apple Framework & Telemetry Audit

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit examines the Signal iOS application's reliance on Apple-specific frameworks and investigates its tracking/telemetry mechanisms.

**Key Apple Dependencies:**
Signal iOS is fundamentally built upon Apple's **UIKit** for its user interface and **Foundation** for core data types and utilities. For multimedia, **AVFoundation** and **AVFAudio** are essential. Native user experience is enhanced through integrations with **CallKit** (for system call UI), **UserNotifications** (for APNs), **Intents** (SiriKit for messaging/calls), and **BackgroundTasks** (for background processing). **Network.framework** is used specifically for the Signal Proxy feature, while general networking relies on `URLSession` and other abstractions. **App Groups** are critical for data sharing between the main app and its extensions (NSE, Share).

**Tracking & Telemetry:**
The audit found **no evidence of third-party analytics or tracking SDKs** being used. Signal's `README.md` states it "doesn't collect any analytics or telemetry," which is supported by keyword searches for common tracking patterns yielding no relevant results.
Signal employs a user-initiated **debug log submission system** (`debuglogs.org`) which can include detailed logs (from `CocoaLumberjack`), crash information (logged locally via `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler`), and performance metrics for diagnostic purposes. This system is not automated for general telemetry.

**Overall, Signal iOS leverages Apple frameworks for a native user experience and core functionality but appears to strictly limit data collection to user-consented debug logs, with no apparent general analytics or user tracking.**

## 2. Detailed List of Apple Frameworks Used

Based on analysis of import statements and common usage patterns:

*   **`AVFAudio`**
    *   **Purpose:** Audio playback/recording, session management (voice messages, calls, notifications).
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Unlikely.

*   **`AVFoundation`**
    *   **Purpose:** Advanced audio/video handling, media capture (camera), playback, processing.
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Unlikely.

*   **`BackgroundTasks`**
    *   **Purpose:** Scheduling and managing background tasks (e.g., message fetching, database maintenance).
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential (for modern background processing).
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Unlikely, though task content could change. The framework itself is standard for iOS background execution.

*   **`CallKit`**
    *   **Purpose:** Integrating calls with the native iOS call UI, call history, and interactions.
    *   **Categorization:** Apple Service Integration.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Possible, but would lose significant native call UX integration and features like call blocking/identification via the system.

*   **`CoreServices`** (Primarily for UTIs via Share Extension)
    *   **Purpose:** Lower-level type information, UTI handling.
    *   **Categorization:** Convenience/UI Apple-isms (modern alternative is `UniformTypeIdentifiers`).
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Largely superseded by `UniformTypeIdentifiers`.

*   **`CryptoKit`**
    *   **Purpose:** Modern cryptographic operations (hashing, potentially Secure Enclave interactions).
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential (if used for hardware-backed features like Secure Enclave) / Convenience Apple-isms (if used for generic crypto operations that could be performed by cross-platform libraries).
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Unlikely if tied to Secure Enclave. Signal's core E2EE is handled by `LibSignalClient`. CryptoKit might be used for platform-specific utilities.

*   **`Foundation`**
    *   **Purpose:** Fundamental data types, utilities, networking basics, file system interaction.
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** No. This is a core building block.

*   **`Intents`** (SiriKit)
    *   **Purpose:** Enabling Siri/Shortcuts for sending messages and initiating calls.
    *   **Categorization:** Apple Service Integration.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Possible, with loss of Siri/Shortcuts voice command functionality.

*   **`MediaPlayer`**
    *   **Purpose:** Managing "Now Playing" info for system media controls (e.g., lock screen controls for audio messages), responding to remote control events.
    *   **Categorization:** Apple Service Integration.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Possible. Core media playback would remain, but OS-level media control integration would be lost.

*   **`Network`**
    *   **Purpose:** Used specifically for the Signal Proxy feature (`NWListener` for local proxy server, `NWConnection` for outgoing proxy connections).
    *   **Categorization:** Convenience Apple-isms (as it's for an optional, advanced feature; core networking uses `URLSession`).
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Yes, if the proxy feature were removed or re-implemented using different underlying technology.

*   **`PushKit`**
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily for VoIP push notifications to ensure reliable call delivery.
    *   **Categorization:** Apple Service Integration.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Depends on call signaling strategy. Modern iOS often uses APNs with `UserNotifications` for call signaling too. Its current usage for new call signaling (vs. APNs) seems minimal based on `PushRegistrationManager`.

*   **`SystemConfiguration`**
    *   **Purpose:** Network reachability monitoring. (Note: Signal also uses the third-party `Reachability.swift` library).
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential / Convenience.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** Potentially, if all reachability is consistently handled by the third-party `Reachability.swift` library.

*   **`UIKit`**
    *   **Purpose:** Core iOS UI elements, event handling, application structure.
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential.
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** No (not without a full UI framework rewrite, e.g., to SwiftUI or a cross-platform UI framework).

*   **`UserNotifications`**
    *   **Purpose:** Handling APNs registration, processing incoming notifications (rich content in NSE), managing notification presentation and actions.
    *   **Categorization:** Core OS Essential (for any push notification functionality).
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** No (for APNs-based pushes).

*   **`UniformTypeIdentifiers`** (Share Extension)
    *   **Purpose:** Modern handling of data types (UTIs) being shared into the extension.
    *   **Categorization:** Convenience/UI Apple-isms (standard best practice on modern iOS).
    *   **Removal/Replacement:** No, this is the current standard.

## 3. Analysis of Key Apple Service Integrations

*   **APNs (`UserNotifications.framework`):** Signal uses APNs for all user-facing remote notifications. The Notification Service Extension (`SignalNSE`) is critical for processing these pushes to fetch content and display rich notifications (respecting privacy settings). Token registration is managed by `PushRegistrationManager`, and token submission to Signal's backend is handled by `SyncPushTokensJob`. (Detailed flow documented in sub-task I.7).

*   **CallKit (`CallKit.framework`):**
    *   `CallKitCallUIAdaptee` acts as the `CXProviderDelegate`, managing call reporting (incoming/outgoing) and system actions. `CallKitCallManager` uses `CXCallController` to send call control actions (start, end, mute) from Signal to iOS.
    *   This provides native iOS call UI, Recents integration, and enables Siri call initiation. Display names in CallKit respect privacy settings.

*   **SiriKit / Intents (`Intents.framework`):**
    *   The main app's `AppDelegate` handles `INSendMessageIntent` and `INStartCallIntent` (and variants). No separate Intents Extension for these core actions was found.
    *   `Info.plist` declares `NSUserActivityTypes` for these intents.
    *   For messages, SiriKit opens the relevant chat. For calls, it initiates them via `CallService`, integrating with CallKit.

*   **BackgroundTasks Framework:**
    *   Used for deferrable background work. Tasks are registered in `AppDelegate` and defined in separate runner classes (mostly in `Signal/src/`).
    *   **Identifiers & Purposes:**
        *   `MessageFetchBGRefreshTask` (`BGAppRefreshTaskRequest`): Periodically fetches messages.
        *   `MessageAttachmentMigrationTask` (`IncrementalMessageTSAttachmentMigrationRunner`): `BGProcessingTaskRequest` for attachment data migration.
        *   `AttachmentValidationBackfillMigrator` (`AttachmentValidationBackfillRunner`): `BGProcessingTaskRequest` for revalidating attachments.
        *   `LazyDatabaseMigratorTask` (`LazyDatabaseMigratorRunner`): `BGProcessingTaskRequest` for deferred database maintenance. (File for runner `SignalServiceKit/Storage/LazyDatabaseMigratorRunner.swift` was confirmed in `AppDelegate` but not directly read in this audit phase due to pathing issues).
    *   The `Signal/src/BGProcessingTaskRunner.swift` protocol helps manage processing tasks.

*   **Network.framework:**
    *   Usage is **limited to the Signal Proxy feature** (`SignalServiceKit/Network/SignalProxy/`).
    *   `NWListener` creates a local TCP server for in-app proxying.
    *   `NWConnection` handles connections from this local server to the remote Signal TLS proxy.
    *   It is **not** used for general API calls or message transport, which rely on `URLSession` (via `OWSUrlSession`) and `libsignalNet`. `NWPathMonitor` is not used; reachability uses a third-party library.

*   **App Groups:**
    *   **IDs:** `group.$(SIGNAL_BUNDLEID_PREFIX).signal.group` (Production) and `group.$(SIGNAL_BUNDLEID_PREFIX).signal.group.staging` (Staging), defined in `SignalServiceKit/TSConstants.swift`.
    *   **Usage:** Critical for data sharing (main database via GRDB, shared `UserDefaults`, potentially other files) between the main app, Notification Service Extension (`SignalNSE`), and Share Extension (`SignalShareExtension`). All three contexts (`MainAppContext`, `NSEContext`, `ShareAppExtensionContext`) use `TSConstants.applicationGroup`.

*   **Extensions Audit:**
    *   **Notification Service Extension (`SignalNSE`):** Primarily uses **`UserNotifications`** (essential) and **`Foundation`**.
    *   **Share Extension (`SignalShareExtension`):** Primarily uses **`UIKit`** (essential), **`Foundation`**, **`UniformTypeIdentifiers`** (and `CoreServices`), and uses **`Intents`** for contextual share targets.

## 4. Report on Identified Tracking/Telemetry Mechanisms

*   **Third-Party SDKs:**
    *   Analysis of the `Podfile` revealed **no common third-party analytics or user behavior tracking SDKs** (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Segment, Sentry for crash reporting).
    *   **`CocoaLumberjack`** is included as a logging framework.

*   **Signal's Native Mechanisms:**
    *   **Crash Reporting:** An `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler` in `AppDelegate.swift` logs crash details locally via `CocoaLumberjack`. There is **no automated system to send these raw crash reports directly to Signal servers.** Crash information is included in debug logs if a user chooses to submit them. Apple's built-in crash reporting would also be available to Signal.
    *   **Debug Log Submission (`Signal/util/DebugLogs.swift`):** This is the primary diagnostic mechanism. It's user-initiated (or error-prompted). Logs (including app logs, version, limited account info, local performance metrics, and prior crash reports) are uploaded to `https://debuglogs.org/`, and the user is given a URL to share.
    *   **Telemetry/Analytics:** Keyword searches (`telemetry`, `analytics`, `usageData`, `metrics` in a tracking context) and code review yielded no evidence of systems for collecting or transmitting general user activity, feature usage, or product analytics to Signal servers. This aligns with Signal's public statements.

## 5. Diagram/Description of the Current Push Notification Flow

(This section references the detailed textual description from sub-task I.7, which is part of this consolidated document)

1.  **App Registration for APNs:** User grants permission (`UNUserNotificationCenter`), app requests token (`registerForRemoteNotifications`), `AppDelegate` receives token and passes to `PushRegistrationManager`.
2.  **Token Submission:** `SyncPushTokensJob` sends the APNs token to Signal's backend servers (`OWSRequestFactory.registerForPushRequest`).
3.  **Server Sends Push:** Signal backend sends push via APNs for new events.
4.  **iOS Delivers Push:** To NSE (if background/mutable) or main app (if foreground).
5.  **NSE Processing (`SignalNSE`):**
    *   Receives push via `didReceive(_:withContentHandler:)`.
    *   Fetches message details from Signal server (via App Group data access).
    *   Modifies `UNMutableNotificationContent` (title, body, badge, actions), respecting privacy settings.
    *   Calls `contentHandler` to display the rich notification.
6.  **Main App Push Handling (`AppDelegate`):**
    *   Foreground: `userNotificationCenter(_:willPresent:...)` usually allows system display.
    *   Background/Launch: `application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:...)` triggers message fetching.
7.  **Notification Display:** Usually by iOS after NSE processing.

## 6. "Hot List": Candidates for De-Applefication / Further Investigation

This list identifies components heavily tied to Apple's ecosystem where a shift to a more cross-platform approach would require substantial effort or lead to noticeable UX changes on iOS.

1.  **`UIKit` (Core OS Essential):**
    *   **Impact:** Fundamental to the entire application's UI and UX.
    *   **De-Applefication:** Would require a complete UI rewrite using a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native, Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform with its own UI solution) or a custom C++ UI library. This is the most significant dependency.

2.  **`CallKit.framework` (Apple Service Integration):**
    *   **Impact:** Provides deep integration with the native iOS call UI, call history, and system interactions (Siri, Bluetooth, car integration).
    *   **De-Applefication:** Would mean building a fully custom in-app calling UI. Users would lose the native call experience, and features like answering calls from the lock screen or managing Signal calls alongside native calls would be significantly different or lost.

3.  **`UserNotifications.framework` & APNs (Core OS Essential for Push):**
    *   **Impact:** APNs is the sole mechanism for delivering push notifications to iOS devices when the app is not active.
    *   **De-Applefication:** While the *client-side* framework is Apple-specific, the *concept* of push notifications is cross-platform. De-Applefication would focus on ensuring the push payload content and server-side generation are as platform-agnostic as possible, so the same backend logic can serve different push services (APNs, FCM). The client-side handling of the received push would still need to use `UserNotifications.framework`.

4.  **App Groups (Core OS Essential for Extension Data Sharing):**
    *   **Impact:** Critical for data sharing between the main app and its extensions (NSE for rich notifications, Share Extension).
    *   **De-Applefication:** If extensions are part of a cross-platform strategy, alternative Inter-Process Communication (IPC) or shared data storage mechanisms compatible with the chosen cross-platform framework would be needed for those platforms. On iOS, App Groups would likely remain for extensions.

5.  **`Intents.framework` (SiriKit - Apple Service Integration):**
    *   **Impact:** Enables voice commands via Siri for sending messages and initiating calls, plus Shortcuts integration.
    *   **De-Applefication:** This functionality would be lost on iOS if not explicitly re-implemented using any cross-platform voice assistant abstraction layers (which are rare and limited).

6.  **`BackgroundTasks.framework` (Core OS Essential for modern background execution):**
    *   **Impact:** Manages deferrable background activities like database cleanup and message fetching to optimize system resources.
    *   **De-Applefication:** The specific framework is Apple-only. A cross-platform app would need to use the equivalent background task scheduling mechanisms provided by each target OS. The logic *within* the tasks (e.g., database cleanup) could be cross-platform.

7.  **`PushKit` (Apple Service Integration - for VoIP):**
    *   **Impact:** Used for high-priority delivery of VoIP notifications, often ensuring call setup even when the app is not active.
    *   **De-Applefication:** If Signal relies on PushKit for unique advantages over data APNs for call signaling, replacing it would require ensuring the alternative (e.g., high-priority data APNs) meets reliability needs on iOS. Its usage seems to be diminishing in favor of APNs for some call signaling.

**Frameworks with Lower "De-Applefication" Concern (Generally replaceable or fundamental utilities):**
*   `Foundation`: Core utilities, many concepts have direct cross-platform equivalents.
*   `AVFoundation` / `AVFAudio`: While Apple-specific, core audio/video capture and playback are features that cross-platform frameworks usually provide abstractions for, or platform-specific implementations would be needed anyway.
*   `CryptoKit`: If used for generic crypto, alternatives exist. If for Secure Enclave, that's a hardware-tied feature.
*   `UniformTypeIdentifiers`: Modern standard for UTIs; cross-platform solutions would have their own UTI handling.
*   `Network.framework`: Usage is already isolated to the optional Signal Proxy feature.

This audit provides a snapshot based on code structure and common practices. Deeper analysis of specific API call sites would be necessary for a granular understanding of each framework's indispensability for particular features.
